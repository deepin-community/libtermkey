Description: library for processing keyboard input
 This library allows easy processing of keyboard entry from terminal-based
 programs. It handles all the necessary logic to recognise special keys, UTF-8
 combining, and so on, with a simple interface.  It provides the following
 features:
 .
  * Follows terminfo for every sequence listed there, only falling back on
    other methods to deal with unrecognised input.
  * Recognises special keys (such as arrow and function keys), including
    "modified" keys like Ctrl-Left.
  * Recognises XTerm-style mouse position/button reporting.
  * MIT licenced to allow almost all projects to use it; both Open Source
    and Commercial.
  * Small API - just three functions are needed in simple common cases.
  * Both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) APIs are
    supported.
